                            <h11>Gun violence at the forefront</h11>
                            <p>Tragedy struck early and persisted throughout 2023. A Jan. 23 shooting in Monterey Park, Calif., killed 11 people in a predominately Asian community, sparking national concerns over anti-Asian hate and a Vanderbilt faculty-led <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/04/a-perfect-storm-vanderbilt-faculty-lead-panel-on-gun-violence-asian-americans">panel on gun violence.</a></p>
                            <p>College campuses were not immune to this rise in gun violence. Three students were killed at <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/17/students-and-administrators-express-concern-following-shooting-at-michigan-state-university/">Michigan State University</a>, one professor at the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/19/vanderbilt-community-shocked-sorrowed-by-aug-28-shooting-sept-13-lockdown-at-unc-chapel-hill/">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> and three professors at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas in February, August and December, respectively, while several were injured at shootings at <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/08/students-express-grief-sorrow-about-shootings-at-morgan-state-bowie-state-universities/">Morgan State and Bowie State Universities</a> within a week in October.</p> 
                            <p>In November, a Belmont University first-year <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/09/belmont-university-student-shot-in-edgehill-passes-away-from-injuries/">passed away</a> a day after being “accidentally” shot in the Edgehill neighborhood, mere minutes from Vanderbilt’s campus. These incidents sparked powerful <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/17/abel-in-case-i-die-in-a-school-shooting/">reflections</a> about the potential to fall victim to yet another school shooting.</p>
                            <p>Gun violence tore through the Vanderbilt community in March at <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/27/breaking-seven-dead-after-covenant-school-shooting-in-green-hills/">The Covenant School</a> — just four miles away from Vanderbilt. <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/28/vanderbilt-and-elected-leaders-respond-to-covenant-school-shooting/">The university, elected officials</a> and the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/31/heartbreaking-vanderbilt-community-reacts-to-covenant-school-shooting/">Vanderbilt community</a> came together to grieve and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/30/in-photos-nashville-holds-vigil-in-honor-of-covenant-school-shooting-victims/">honor</a> the lives lost, but you also turned your sadness and anger into action. Vanderbilt students working with March for Our Lives and Students Demand Action <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/01/vanderbilt-students-organize-walkout-for-gun-control-honor-victims-of-covenant-school-shooting/">organized</a> a city-wide <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/11/in-photos-nashville-community-rallies-in-reaction-to-covenant-school-shooting-downtown-at-fisk-university/">walkout</a> on April 3, bringing together over <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/06/over-7000-rally-for-gun-reform-in-march-organized-by-vanderbilt-students-protests-to-continue-at-capitol/">7,000</a> students and community members to advocate for gun reform.</p>
                            <p>These efforts were not in vain — in the weeks following repeated protests, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/11/gov-lee-strengthens-background-checks-calls-for-red-flag-laws-in-wake-of-covenant-school-shooting-and-student-protests/">signed legislation</a> to strengthen background check requirements for firearm purchases and call for red flag laws. Despite the devastation, you remained hopeful: You expressed cautious optimism about President Joe Biden’s then-new national <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/12/vanderbilt-community-optimistic-hestitant-about-new-national-office-of-gun-violence-prevention/">Office of Gun Violence Prevention</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/08/weitzel-teaching-healed-me-but-vanderbilt-owes-its-teachers-so-much-more/">urged Vanderbilt</a> to leverage its power to protect our nation’s future teachers.</p>

                            <h11>Protest and advocacy</h11>
                            <p>Calling for stronger gun safety laws was only the beginning of your advocacy and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/05/notes-from-nash-notes-with-katey-parham-activism/">activism</a>. When “Tennessee Three” Reps. Justin Jones (D – Nashville), Justin Pearson (D – Memphis) and Gloria Johnson (D – Knoxville) joined the April 3 protesters in calls for gun control, and the former two were <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/07/the-nation-is-watching-students-lead-protests-as-rep-justin-jones-and-rep-justin-pearson-are-expelled/">expelled</a> from the Tennessee House, you led protests in support of their <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/12/reps-justin-jones-and-justin-pearson-unanimously-reinstated-students-lead-marches-in-support/">reinstatement.</a></p>
                            <p>When the Tennessee General Assembly convened in August to address gun violence, you <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/08/27/special-session-of-tennessee-congress-addressing-gun-violence-sparks-protests-by-vanderbilt-students-demand-action/">protested</a> proposed bills calling for additional firearms to be placed in schools. In October, you traveled to the grand opening of the headquarters of <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/12/students-demand-action-rally-against-smith-wesson-headquarters-grand-opening/">Smith & Wesson</a> — the nation’s largest gun manufacturer — in Maryville, Tenn., to denounce the organization’s “irresponsible practices and demand accountability.”</p>
                            <p>You also <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/20/liberation-justice-and-freedom-vanderbilt-students-attend-rally-for-palestine-at-statehouse/">gathered</a> at the Municipal Courthouse in April in support of Palestinian freedom. Activism over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict intensified dramatically following Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks that sparked an Israeli declaration of war. First, you mourned at a vigil for Israeli lives lost and at a community prayer for Palestinian lives lost.</p>
                            <p>Then, you <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/29/students-rally-outside-rand-dining-hall-in-support-of-israel-palestine/">protested</a> — some in support of Israel, others <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/21/students-call-for-ceasefire-in-gaza-at-rand-dining-center-amid-exhibits-from-sjp-hillel/">decrying</a> the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. Your advocacy took different forms, including <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/29/students-rally-outside-rand-dining-hall-in-support-of-israel-palestine/">rallies</a> outside Rand Dining Hall, <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/21/students-call-for-ceasefire-in-gaza-at-rand-dining-center-amid-exhibits-from-sjp-hillel/">banners</a> around campus, <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/21/students-call-for-ceasefire-in-gaza-at-rand-dining-center-amid-exhibits-from-sjp-hillel/">exhibits</a> in Fleming Yard and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/12/10/divinity-students-sjp-organize-in-support-of-gaza-ceasefire/">posters</a> at the Divinity School. Demonstrations extended beyond campus, too. You frequented protests at <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/15/protestors-call-for-ceasefire-in-middle-east-at-centennial-park/">Centennial Park</a> and downtown Nashville and traveled to Washington, D.C., for a national <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/21/vanderbilt-students-attend-national-march-for-israel-in-dc/">March for Israel.</a></p>
                            <p>As protests increased, so did hate-based incidents. As early as March, the nearby Sylvan Park neighborhood was <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/21/vanderbilt-community-reacts-to-sylvan-park-neighborhood-being-vandalized-with-swastikas-hate-speech/">vandalized</a> with swastikas and hate speech. The following month, the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/03/unacceptable-and-morally-reprehensible-vanderbilt-community-reacts-to-antisemitic-and-homophobic-vandalism-at-blair-school-of-music/">Blair School of Music</a> was also vandalized, both with an antisemitic symbol and homophobic language. Muslim and Jewish students on campus <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/30/muslim-students-voice-campus-safety-concerns-in-wake-of-war-in-gaza/">reported an increase</a> in Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents on campus in the wake of the conflict in Gaza and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/12/15/guest-editorial-vanderbilt-needs-to-do-more-to-stop-antisemitism-on-campus/">urged administrators</a> to take action.</p>
                            <p>On campus, students advocated for <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/22/smith-pay-vuceptors-or-risk-losing-them-for-good/">VUceptors</a>, graduate students, and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/06/14/elevate-the-people-on-the-ground-dining-employee-reflects-on-vanderbilt-experience/">staff</a> <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/23/a-true-leader-community-members-celebrate-life-of-staff-member-olivia-parrish/">members</a>: VUceptors voted in favor of award-style <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/23/vuceptors-vote-in-favor-of-award-style-compensation/">compensation</a>, A&S graduate student stipends <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/01/20/as-graduate-student-stipends-to-increase-by-up-to-7-9/">increased</a> by up to nearly 8%, the Student Health Insurance Plan added <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/03/ship-to-include-dental-and-vision-coverage-starting-this-fall/">dental and vision coverage</a>, and students launched the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/23/university-acknowledges-another-on-campus-construction-death-students-launch-dores-worker-solidarity-network/">Dores Worker Solidarity Network.</a></p>
                            
                            <h11>New technology emerges — and sparks controversy</h11>
                            <p>In 2023, ChatGPT and AI took the world by storm. In response to the shooting at Michigan State, an administrator of Peabody College’s Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion sent a message to students of condolence and support <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/17/peabody-edi-office-responds-to-msu-shooting-with-email-written-using-chatgpt/">written by ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/26/fellas-vanderbilts-chatgpt-email-is-automated-hypocrisy/">inciting sharp criticism</a> from the Vanderbilt — and global — communities. Two of the office’s deans <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/19/peabody-edi-deans-to-temporarily-step-back-following-chatgpt-crafted-message-about-msu-shooting/">temporarily stepped back</a> while an investigation was underway <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/12/peabody-edi-deans-nicole-joseph-hasina-mohyuddin-reinstated-after-utilizing-chatgpt-to-write-an-email-about-msu-shooting/">but were reinstated</a> just under two months later.</p>

                            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/07/25/vanderbilt-community-reacts-to-supreme-court-striking-down-affirmative-action/">banned race-based affirmative action</a> in June, forcing schools — including Vanderbilt — to <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/06/29/vanderbilt-must-change-admissions-processes-after-u-s-supreme-court-bans-race-based-affirmative-action/">revise their admissions policies</a>. Chancellor Daniel Diermeier reaffirmed Vanderbilt’s <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/06/30/chancellor-diermeier-deeply-disappointed-in-u-s-supreme-court-overturning-of-affirmative-action/">commitment to diversity</a>, which the Office of Undergraduate Admissions <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/12/15/diversity-in-vanderbilt-admissions-post-affirmative-action-and-2024-u-s-news-ranking/">has been working to uphold</a> at Vanderbilt while adhering to the new laws. During the summer of 2023, the university also began <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/12/06/vanderbilt-edi-efforts-decentralized-in-favor-of-layered-collaborative-approach/">decentralizing</a> its equity, diversity, inclusion and belonging efforts to streamline student and community support. </p>
                            <p>At the start of the 2023-24 academic year, U.S. News released its annual university rankings, dropping Vanderbilt five places to No. 18 — its <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/19/vanderbilt-drops-to-lowest-u-s-news-rank-since-2009-university-officials-denounce-methodology/">lowest ranking since 2009</a>. University officials <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/26/diermeier-raver-further-express-outrage-about-u-s-news-ranking-methodology-in-follow-up-email/">vehemently</a> <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/19/chancellor-diermeier-provost-raver-criticize-incompetent-u-s-news-ranking-methodology-after-drop-in-rank/">denounced</a> the change in U.S. News methodology that contributed to many universities shifting ranks, calling the new system “incompetent.” Students <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/24/chung-vanderbilt-reveals-its-true-colors-after-dropping-in-rank/">criticized</a> Vanderbilt’s response to dropping in rank.</p>
                            <p>Despite the post-rankings frenzy, Vanderbilt’s admissions rates continued to decline — the university hit record low acceptance rates of <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/20/vanderbilt-admits-15-7-of-early-decision-applicants-record-low/">15.7% for early decision</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/20/record-low-5-6-of-applicants-admitted-to-class-of-2027-admission-rates-continue-to-decline/">5.6% for regular decision</a> for the Class of 2027. The year also welcomed the first members of the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/12/15/first-members-of-class-of-2028-welcomed-to-vanderbilt-via-early-decision-i/">Class of 2028</a> via early decision I, though for the second year in a row, no admissions statistics for the EDI cycle were released. The combined EDI and EDII admissions rate <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/02/28/vanderbilt-early-decision-acceptance-rate-dips-slightly-to-15-2/">fell to 15.2%</a> for the Class of 2028.</p>

                            <p>Amid violence, protest and controversy, Vanderbilt piloted the Dialogue Vanderbilt initiative to promote free speech and civil discourse on campus, which Diermeier has often cited as the reason for better campus civility compared to peer institutions.</p>
                            <p>As part of Dialogue Vanderbilt, the university hosted its inaugural Free Speech Week and curated a lineup of Open Dialogue Visiting Fellows to speak on the initiative’s inaugural theme, “What is College For? Administrative emphasis on free speech, civil discourse and principled neutrality raised concerns among community members on the distinction between free speech and hate speech, particularly following conservative political commentator Michael Knowles’s visit to campus in November.</p>
                            <p>Even before the official launch of Dialogue Vanderbilt, debates ensued on campus: Vanderbilt College Republicans hosted discourse over affirmative action and gender-affirming care for transgender minors — sparking backlash from students and campus organizations, while the university hosted a forum for discussion on university TikTok bans.</p>
                            <p>The university hosted several high-profile visitors in 2023, including Bill and Hillary Clinton and Pete Buttigieg for the 2023 Clinton Global Initiative University; LGBTQ+ rights activist Jim Obergefell, namesake of the U.S. Supreme Court case that legalized gay marriage; U.S. Army General and Cyber Command Director Paul Nakasone; Nobel Peace Prize-winning journalist Maria Ressa; Me Too Movement founder Tarana Burke; “New Girl” actor Max Greenfield; and Nobel Prize in Physics winner Carl Wieman.</p>

                            <p>In the wake of devastating gun violence that shattered our community, I found myself at a loss for words. Noah’s profoundly personal expression of grieving and moving forward deeply resonated with me — I continue to think about Noah’s words months later. Wounds heal with time, Noah tells us, but our fight to remain safe in school will continue. </p>

In this episode of Hot Girl Tech, Vienna Parnell and Soha Bhutta take creativity to a whole new level, crafting an episode to which I consistently go back for inspiration. Their support of women in computer science and technology is something that makes their podcast notable, especially for students here at Vanderbilt.</p>

                            <p>I can’t read this piece without tearing up. As an education major, I have read the horrifying headlines of school shootings from the classroom as a student and from the sidelines as a pre-service teacher. Reading Opinion Editor Zoe Abel’s piece stuck with me because it was heartbreakingly unique. Her piece led me to think about my future and safety in the classroom — an unfortunate reality for educators everywhere.</p>

                            <p>Even weeks after the Covenant School shooting and amid subsequent community and political action surrounding gun laws, I was still paralyzed by my horrifically unique perspective as a reporter during tragedy in my community. Writing this piece helped me to shine a light on the often unspoken trauma experienced by journalists covering tragedy; process my feelings and grief; and inspire Vanderbilt community members to think critically about issues surrounding them.</p>

                            <p>My favorite thing about a well-researched and thoroughly sourced investigative news piece is the way it captures the breadth and depth of a topic, often one about which the writer might not initially know much. Covering the news of the apartment tower soon to be constructed across from Zeppos College was an incredible opportunity — I had the chance to interview the former mayor and real estate executives as well as delve into Vanderbilt and Nashville’s evolving landscape over the past few decades.</p>
