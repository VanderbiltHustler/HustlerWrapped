                            <h11>Gun violence at the forefront</h11>
                            <p>Tragedy struck early and persisted throughout 2023. A Jan. 23 shooting in Monterey Park, Calif., killed 11 people in a predominately Asian community, sparking national concerns over anti-Asian hate and a Vanderbilt faculty-led <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/04/a-perfect-storm-vanderbilt-faculty-lead-panel-on-gun-violence-asian-americans">panel on gun violence.</a></p>
                            <p>College campuses were not immune to this rise in gun violence. Three students were killed at <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/17/students-and-administrators-express-concern-following-shooting-at-michigan-state-university/">Michigan State University</a>, one professor at the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/19/vanderbilt-community-shocked-sorrowed-by-aug-28-shooting-sept-13-lockdown-at-unc-chapel-hill/">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> and three professors at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas in February, August and December, respectively, while several were injured at shootings at <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/08/students-express-grief-sorrow-about-shootings-at-morgan-state-bowie-state-universities/">Morgan State and Bowie State Universities</a> within a week in October.</p> 
                            <p>In November, a Belmont University first-year <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/09/belmont-university-student-shot-in-edgehill-passes-away-from-injuries/">passed away</a> a day after being “accidentally” shot in the Edgehill neighborhood, mere minutes from Vanderbilt’s campus. These incidents sparked powerful <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/17/abel-in-case-i-die-in-a-school-shooting/">reflections</a> about the potential to fall victim to yet another school shooting.</p>
                            <p>Gun violence tore through the Vanderbilt community in March at <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/27/breaking-seven-dead-after-covenant-school-shooting-in-green-hills/">The Covenant School</a> — just four miles away from Vanderbilt. <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/28/vanderbilt-and-elected-leaders-respond-to-covenant-school-shooting/">The university, elected officials</a> and the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/31/heartbreaking-vanderbilt-community-reacts-to-covenant-school-shooting/">Vanderbilt community</a> came together to grieve and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/30/in-photos-nashville-holds-vigil-in-honor-of-covenant-school-shooting-victims/">honor</a> the lives lost, but you also turned your sadness and anger into action. Vanderbilt students working with March for Our Lives and Students Demand Action <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/01/vanderbilt-students-organize-walkout-for-gun-control-honor-victims-of-covenant-school-shooting/">organized</a> a city-wide <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/11/in-photos-nashville-community-rallies-in-reaction-to-covenant-school-shooting-downtown-at-fisk-university/">walkout</a> on April 3, bringing together over <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/06/over-7000-rally-for-gun-reform-in-march-organized-by-vanderbilt-students-protests-to-continue-at-capitol/">7,000</a> students and community members to advocate for gun reform. <a href = "https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/31/one-year-later-community-links-arms-to-honor-victims-of-covenant-school-shooting-and-call-for-gun-reform/">One year later</a>, 13,000 community members came together to form a four-mile-long human chain commemorating the lives lost in the shooting and calling for gun reform.</p>

                            <p>These efforts were not in vain — in the weeks following repeated protests, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/11/gov-lee-strengthens-background-checks-calls-for-red-flag-laws-in-wake-of-covenant-school-shooting-and-student-protests/">signed legislation</a> to strengthen background check requirements for firearm purchases and call for red flag laws. Despite the devastation, you remained hopeful: You expressed cautious optimism about President Joe Biden’s then-new national <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/12/vanderbilt-community-optimistic-hestitant-about-new-national-office-of-gun-violence-prevention/">Office of Gun Violence Prevention</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/08/weitzel-teaching-healed-me-but-vanderbilt-owes-its-teachers-so-much-more/">urged Vanderbilt</a> to leverage its power to protect our nation’s future teachers.</p>
                            <p>Gov. Lee again made national headlines on April 26 when he signed into law a bill allowing teachers and school staff to be <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/04/14/vanderbilt-community-reacts-to-tennessee-senate-bill-permitting-teachers-to-carry-handguns-in-schools/">armed</a> in school buildings and public campuses throughout Tennessee. </p>

                            <h11>Protest and advocacy</h11>
                            <p>Calling for stronger gun safety laws was only the beginning of your advocacy and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/05/notes-from-nash-notes-with-katey-parham-activism/">activism</a>. When “Tennessee Three” Reps. Justin Jones (D – Nashville), Justin Pearson (D – Memphis) and Gloria Johnson (D – Knoxville) joined the April 3 protesters in calls for gun control, and the former two were <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/07/the-nation-is-watching-students-lead-protests-as-rep-justin-jones-and-rep-justin-pearson-are-expelled/">expelled</a> from the Tennessee House, you led protests in support of their <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/12/reps-justin-jones-and-justin-pearson-unanimously-reinstated-students-lead-marches-in-support/">reinstatement.</a></p>
                            <p>When the Tennessee General Assembly convened in August to address gun violence, you <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/08/27/special-session-of-tennessee-congress-addressing-gun-violence-sparks-protests-by-vanderbilt-students-demand-action/">protested</a> proposed bills calling for additional firearms to be placed in schools. In October, you traveled to the grand opening of the headquarters of <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/12/students-demand-action-rally-against-smith-wesson-headquarters-grand-opening/">Smith & Wesson</a> — the nation’s largest gun manufacturer — in Maryville, Tenn., to denounce the organization’s “irresponsible practices and demand accountability.”</p>

First, you mourned at a <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/12/in-photos-vanderbilt-community-members-attend-chabad-and-hillel-vigil-for-lives-lost-in-israel/">vigil</a> for Israeli lives lost and at a <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/15/in-photos-sjp-and-msa-host-community-prayer-for-palestinian-lives-lost/">community prayer</a> for Palestinian lives lost.</p>
                            <p>Then, you <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/29/students-rally-outside-rand-dining-hall-in-support-of-israel-palestine/">protested</a> — some in support of Israel, others <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/21/students-call-for-ceasefire-in-gaza-at-rand-dining-center-amid-exhibits-from-sjp-hillel/">decrying</a> the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. Your advocacy took different forms, including <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/29/students-rally-outside-rand-dining-hall-in-support-of-israel-palestine/">rallies</a> outside Rand Dining Hall, banners around campus, exhibits in Fleming Yard and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/12/10/divinity-students-sjp-organize-in-support-of-gaza-ceasefire/">posters</a> at the Divinity School. Demonstrations extended beyond campus, too. You frequented protests at <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/15/protestors-call-for-ceasefire-in-middle-east-at-centennial-park/">Centennial Park</a> and downtown Nashville and traveled to Washington, D.C., for a national <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/21/vanderbilt-students-attend-national-march-for-israel-in-dc/">March for Israel.</a></p>
                            <p>As protests increased, so did hate-based incidents. As early as March, the nearby Sylvan Park neighborhood was <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/21/vanderbilt-community-reacts-to-sylvan-park-neighborhood-being-vandalized-with-swastikas-hate-speech/">vandalized</a> with swastikas and hate speech. The following month, the Blair School of Music was <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/03/unacceptable-and-morally-reprehensible-vanderbilt-community-reacts-to-antisemitic-and-homophobic-vandalism-at-blair-school-of-music/">also vandalized</a> with an antisemitic symbol and homophobic language. Muslim and Jewish students on campus <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/30/muslim-students-voice-campus-safety-concerns-in-wake-of-war-in-gaza/">reported an increase</a> in Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents on campus in the wake of the conflict in Gaza and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/12/15/guest-editorial-vanderbilt-needs-to-do-more-to-stop-antisemitism-on-campus/">urged administrators</a> to take action. In February 2024, a group of neo-Nazis <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/02/19/vanderbilt-community-reacts-to-neo-nazi-march-downtown/">marched</a> the streets of downtown Nashville, sparking universal condemnation from the Vanderbilt community.</p>
                            <p>A few days later, <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/03/petition-calling-for-vsg-to-divest-from-pro-israel-organizations-gains-over-600-signatures/">Vanderbilt Divest Coalition</a> submitted a <a href="https://roadmaps.today/?p=30">petition</a> to Vanderbilt Student Government titled “Divest VSG from genocide.” This petition was a response to the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/11/vanderbilt-community-sorrowed-concerned-about-israel-hamas-war/">war in Gaza</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/02/11/mlc-statements-criticize-university-policy-of-principled-neutrality/">frustrations</a> with the administration’s stance of <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/22/debrief-with-diermeier-principled-neutrality-amid-campus-activism/">principled neutrality</a>. Despite being scheduled to go to a vote on March 25 after a petition in its favor gained 600 student signatures, university administrators <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/24/administration-cancels-vsg-bds-amendment-vote-students-protest/">removed</a> the proposition from the ballot over spring break due to Tennesee’s anti-BDS law. After organizing a week-long “Apartheid Wall” exhibit outside Rand Hall, VDC <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/26/breaking-divest-coalition-protesters-sit-in-at-kirkland-hall-at-least-seven-suspended/">rushed</a> into <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/26/inside-kirkland-hall-vanderbilt-divest-coalition-protestors-report-inhumane-treatment-amid-student-suspensions-and-arrest-of-reporter/">Kirkland Hall</a> protesting the university’s cancellation of the student body vote on the VSG BDS amendment. 
                                <p>The <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/27/breaking-students-forcibly-leave-sit-in-three-arrested-and-16-suspended/">22-hour protest</a> resulted in a <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/26/nashville-scene-reporter-arrested-on-campus-press-denied-entry-to-kirkland-hall/">journalist</a> and four students arrested, three students <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/04/06/three-students-expelled-following-student-accountability-hearings-faculty-criticize-university-response/">expelled</a>, one suspended and 22 with disciplinary probations. </p>

                            <h11>New technology emerges — and sparks controversy</h11>
                            <p>In 2023, ChatGPT and AI took the world by storm. In response to the shooting at Michigan State, an administrator of Peabody College’s Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion sent a message to students of condolence and support <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/17/peabody-edi-office-responds-to-msu-shooting-with-email-written-using-chatgpt/">written by ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/26/fellas-vanderbilts-chatgpt-email-is-automated-hypocrisy/">inciting sharp criticism</a> from the Vanderbilt — and global — communities. Two of the office’s deans <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/19/peabody-edi-deans-to-temporarily-step-back-following-chatgpt-crafted-message-about-msu-shooting/">temporarily stepped back</a> while an investigation was underway <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/12/peabody-edi-deans-nicole-joseph-hasina-mohyuddin-reinstated-after-utilizing-chatgpt-to-write-an-email-about-msu-shooting/">but were reinstated</a> just under two months later, with some <a href= "https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/25/harris-in-defense-of-dean-nicole-joseph/">expressing support</a> and arguing that we have lost the ability to separate people from their mistakes.</p>
                            <p>In March 2024, the university announced the creation of a fifth college, the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/31/vanderbilt-to-establish-a-new-college-of-connected-computing/">College of Connected Computing</a>, with programs in computer science, AI and data science. That same month, reports arose of a potential <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/04/10/vanderbilt-eyes-west-palm-beach-for-possible-expansion/">new Vanderbilt business campus</a> in West Palm Beach, Florida, with graduate opportunities particularly at the intersection of finance and computer science.</p>

                            <h11>Vanderbilt responded to higher education changes</h11>
                            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/07/25/vanderbilt-community-reacts-to-supreme-court-striking-down-affirmative-action/">banned race-based affirmative action</a> in June, forcing schools — including Vanderbilt — to <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/06/29/vanderbilt-must-change-admissions-processes-after-u-s-supreme-court-bans-race-based-affirmative-action/">revise their admissions policies</a>. Chancellor Daniel Diermeier reaffirmed Vanderbilt’s <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/06/30/chancellor-diermeier-deeply-disappointed-in-u-s-supreme-court-overturning-of-affirmative-action/">commitment to diversity</a>, which the Office of Undergraduate Admissions <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/12/15/diversity-in-vanderbilt-admissions-post-affirmative-action-and-2024-u-s-news-ranking/">has been working to uphold</a> at Vanderbilt while adhering to the new laws. During the summer of 2023, the university also began <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/12/06/vanderbilt-edi-efforts-decentralized-in-favor-of-layered-collaborative-approach/">decentralizing</a> its equity, diversity, inclusion and belonging efforts to streamline student and community support. </p>
                            <p>At the start of the 2023-24 academic year, U.S. News released its annual university rankings, dropping Vanderbilt five places to No. 18 — its <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/19/vanderbilt-drops-to-lowest-u-s-news-rank-since-2009-university-officials-denounce-methodology/">lowest ranking since 2009</a>. University officials <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/26/diermeier-raver-further-express-outrage-about-u-s-news-ranking-methodology-in-follow-up-email/">vehemently</a> <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/19/chancellor-diermeier-provost-raver-criticize-incompetent-u-s-news-ranking-methodology-after-drop-in-rank/">denounced</a> the change in U.S. News methodology that contributed to many universities shifting ranks, calling the new system “incompetent.” Students <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/24/chung-vanderbilt-reveals-its-true-colors-after-dropping-in-rank/">criticized</a> Vanderbilt’s response to dropping in rank.</p>
                            <p>Despite the post-rankings frenzy, Vanderbilt’s admissions rates continued to decline — the university hit record low acceptance rates of <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/04/11/a-steady-decline-class-of-2028-regular-decision-admission-rate-drops-to-3-7-overall-admission-rate-to-5-1/">15.2% for early decision I and II</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/04/11/a-steady-decline-class-of-2028-regular-decision-admission-rate-drops-to-3-7-overall-admission-rate-to-5-1/">3.7% for regular decision</a> for the Class of 2028.</p>
                            <p>Vanderbilt, following the University of Chicago, became the second school to agree to settle an <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/01/27/vanderbilt-agrees-to-settle-antitrust-lawsuit-five-universities-follow/">antitrust lawsuit</a> alleging they colluded with other top universities to limit student financial aid in November 2023. A February 2024 court filing revealed Vanderbilt’s settlement amount as <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/02/28/vanderbilt-to-pay-55-million-to-settle-antitrust-lawsuit/">$55 million</a> — the most of any university so far. Amid the news of the lawsuit, the university announced an <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/02/18/vanderbilt-guarantees-full-tuition-scholarships-to-all-students-with-family-incomes-below-150000/">expansion of Opportunity Vanderbilt</a>, guaranteeing full-tuition scholarships to all students with family incomes below $150,000.</p>

                            <h11>You engaged with familiar ideas in new ways</h11>
                            <p>Amid violence, protest and controversy, Vanderbilt piloted the Dialogue Vanderbilt initiative to promote <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/12/notes-from-nash-notes-with-mchangama-free-speech/">free speech</a> and civil discourse on campus, which Diermeier has often <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/02/22/dialogue-vanderbilt-hosts-discussion-on-interfaith-dialogue-and-israel-palestine-conflict-with-maha-elgenaidi/">cited</a> as the reason for better campus civility compared to peer institutions.</p>
                            <p>As part of Dialogue Vanderbilt, the university hosted its inaugural <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/02/22/dialogue-vanderbilt-hosts-discussion-on-interfaith-dialogue-and-israel-palestine-conflict-with-maha-elgenaidi/">Free Speech Week</a> and curated a <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/16/dialogue-vanderbilt-hosts-visiting-fellow-jennifer-carlson-for-gun-rights-and-violence-discussion/">lineup</a> of Open Dialogue Visiting Fellows to speak on the initiative’s inaugural theme, “What is College For?"

                            <p>Even before the official launch of Dialogue Vanderbilt, debates ensued on campus: Vanderbilt College Republicans hosted discourse over <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/01/26/both-sides-really-brought-their-a-game-vanderbilt-college-republicans-host-debate-on-affirmative-action/">affirmative action</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/10/vanderbilt-college-republicans-host-debate-on-gender-transitions-for-minors-students-protest-event/">gender-affirming care</a> for transgender minors — sparking backlash from students and campus organizations, while the university hosted a forum for discussion on university <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/05/vanderbilt-co-hosts-debate-on-tiktok-bans-at-universities/">TikTok bans</a>.</p>
                            <p>The university hosted several high-profile visitors during the 2023-24 school year, including Me Too Movement founder <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/12/me-too-founder-tarana-burke-speaks-at-annual-margaret-cuninggim-lecture/">Tarana Burke</a>; “New Girl” actor <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/15/new-girl-star-max-greenfield-speaks-at-annual-vpb-speaker-event/">Max Greenfield</a>; Nobel Prize in Physics winner <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/19/2001-nobel-prize-winner-carl-wieman-delivers-annual-guy-and-rebecca-forman-lecture-in-science-education/">Carl Wieman</a>; former MSNBC host <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/02/05/open-dialogue-invites-melissa-harris-perry-to-speak-on-race-and-affirmative-action/">Melissa Harris-Perry</a>; former U.S. Rep. <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/02/08/liz-cheney-talks-trump-and-2024-elections-during-dialogue-vanderbilt-event/">Liz Cheney</a>; Rabbi <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/01/19/dialogue-vanderbilt-hosts-conversation-between-rabbi-david-wolpe-and-vanderbilt-divinity-school-dean-yolanda-pierce/">David Wolpe</a>; journalist <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/08/dialogue-vanderbilt-hosts-conversation-on-autocracy-with-pulitzer-prize-winning-journalist-anne-applebaum/">Anne Applebaum</a>; religious scholar <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/11/dialogue-vanderbilt-hosts-pride-in-the-pews-founder-don-abram/">Don Abram</a>; journalist <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/30/anderson-cooper-and-ziwe-fumudoh-headline-60th-annual-impact-symposium/">Anderson Cooper</a>; comedian <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/30/anderson-cooper-and-ziwe-fumudoh-headline-60th-annual-impact-symposium/">Ziwe Fumudoh</a>; activist <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/04/14/vsg-hosts-monica-lewinsky-for-discussion-on-public-shaming/">Monica Lewinsky</a>; author <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/04/14/dialogue-vanderbilt-hosts-author-james-patterson-for-discussion-on-censorship-and-the-importance-of-reading/">James Patterson</a>; and Muslim Public Affairs Council President <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/04/29/unity-project-hosts-salam-al-marayati-for-discussion-on-student-protests-and-israeli-palestinian-conflict/">Salam Al-Marayati</a>.</p>

                            <p>Podcasts are special because of their ability to integrate creativity into audio that creates a conversation that involves the listener. In this episode of Hot Girl Tech, Vienna Parnell and Soha Bhutta take creativity to a whole new level, crafting an episode to which I consistently go back for inspiration. Their support of women in computer science and technology is something that makes their podcast notable, especially for students here at Vanderbilt.</p>

                            <p>I can’t read this piece without tearing up. As an education major, I have read the horrifying headlines of school shootings from the classroom as a student and from the sidelines as a pre-service teacher. Reading Opinion Editor Zoe Abel’s piece stuck with me because it was heartbreakingly unique. Her piece led me to think about my future and safety in the classroom — an unfortunate reality for educators everywhere.</p>

                            <p>As the Life Editor, much of the work I edit centers around campus life and events. Pieces that step outside of the Vanderbubble and examine student life outside of campus confines often offer unique perspectives. I love that this piece brings students, faculty and community members together to shed light on an important part of Nashville — Nolensville Pike and the city’s Latinx culture.</p>

                            <p>Many Vanderbilt students express that every week feels like “midterm week.” The Data and News section collaborated on this feature piece, using statistical analysis to explore how testing really works for our undergrads. We analyzed when midterms are, what kinds of midterms are administered and how much they impact students’ grade by collecting over 240 syllabi across all of the university’s colleges. We also gathered testimonials from both students and faculty.</p>

The Hustler’s comprehensive and detailed reporting here, in addition to serving as a vital source of information for students and faculty alike, was on par with professional-level journalism and set a high precedent of coverage for other student papers as similar sit-ins arose across universities nationally and internationally.</p>

                            <p>Many of the student performances in 2023 and 2024 showcased the diversity of cultures on Vanderbilt’s campus.</p>
                            <p>The Association of Latin American Students held its annual <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/05/cafe-con-leche-2023-a-night-of-stars-laughter-and-dance/">Café con Leche</a> on Oct. 28.

                            <p>Vanderbilt’s theatrical student organizations also hosted various musicals throughout 2023 and 2024. The Original Cast performed student-crafted shows such as <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/12/07/the-original-cast-strutted-to-center-stage-for-their-fall-production-curtain-call/">“Curtain Call”</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/04/03/the-doctor-is-in-for-the-original-cast-therapy-session-codependency/">“Codependency,”</a> while Vanderbilt Off-Broadway put on <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/01/19/vanderbilt-off-broadway-goes-back-to-high-school-with-heathers-the-musical/">"Heathers"</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/04/26/beware-of-razzle-dazzle-vobs-performance-of-chicago-is-sure-to-sweep-you-off-your-feet/">“Chicago.”</a></p>
                            <p>In Spring 2024, annual events like <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/04/10/caribbean-students-association-hosts-a-vibrant-carnival/">Carnival</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/04/07/in-photos-harambee-2024/">Harambee</a> brought together the beauty of music and dance. New showcases, including VIDA’s <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/04/21/vidas-spring-showcase-a-night-dancing-with-the-dores/">“Dancing With the ‘Dores,”</a> brought in students from across campus to learn and share a new skill: Latin dance.</p>

                            <p>After an impressive 2022-23 season which included a deep SEC Tournament run and wins against <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/08/vanderbilt-stuns-no-6-tennessee-on-tyrin-lawrence-buzzer-beater-beats-first-top-10-opponent-since-2016/">Tennessee</a>, <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/18/magic-hour-vanderbilt-beats-auburn-at-buzzer-again-wins-fifth-straight/">Auburn</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/02/bubble-watch-wright-commodores-stun-kentucky-to-keep-ncaa-hopes-alive/">Kentucky</a>, the Vanderbilt men’s basketball team lost their magic in the 2023-24 season. Aside from a <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/02/13/memorial-magic-ezra-manjons-buzzer-beater-lifts-vanderbilt-over-texas-am-74-73/">buzzer-beater</a> from <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/06/ezra-manjon-anchor-in-the-backcourt/">Ezra Manjon</a> against Texas A&M, the Commodores were ultimately humbled in SEC play.  Vanderbilt ultimately parted ways with Jerry Stackhouse after the season. The Hustler explained why Stackhouse and Vanderbilt should part ways a <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/02/02/memorial-minutes-rip-off-the-band-aid/">few months</a> before it occurred. Stackhouse is replaced by <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/03/25/vanderbilt-hires-mark-byington-as-next-mens-basketball-head-coach/">Mark Byington</a>. Byington has already reshaped Vanderbilt’s roster via the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/04/19/wilf-why-the-mark-byington-hire-should-bring-donors-back-to-vanderbilt-mens-basketball/">transfer portal</a>.</p>
