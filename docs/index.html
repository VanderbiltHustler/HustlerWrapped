                            <h11>Gun violence at the forefront</h11>
                            <p>Tragedy struck early and persisted throughout 2023. A Jan. 23 shooting in Monterey Park, Calif., killed 11 people in a predominately Asian community, sparking national concerns over anti-Asian hate and a Vanderbilt faculty-led <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/04/a-perfect-storm-vanderbilt-faculty-lead-panel-on-gun-violence-asian-americans">panel on gun violence.</a></p>
                            <p>College campuses were not immune to this rise in gun violence. Three students were killed at <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/17/students-and-administrators-express-concern-following-shooting-at-michigan-state-university/">Michigan State University</a>, one professor at the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/19/vanderbilt-community-shocked-sorrowed-by-aug-28-shooting-sept-13-lockdown-at-unc-chapel-hill/">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> and three professors at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas in February, August and December, respectively, while several were injured at shootings at <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/08/students-express-grief-sorrow-about-shootings-at-morgan-state-bowie-state-universities/">Morgan State and Bowie State Universities</a> within a week in October.</p> 
                            <p>In November, a Belmont University first-year <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/09/belmont-university-student-shot-in-edgehill-passes-away-from-injuries/">passed away</a> a day after being “accidentally” shot in the Edgehill neighborhood, mere minutes from Vanderbilt’s campus. These incidents sparked powerful <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/17/abel-in-case-i-die-in-a-school-shooting/">reflections</a> about the potential to fall victim to yet another school shooting.</p>
                            <p>Gun violence tore through the Vanderbilt community in March at <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/27/breaking-seven-dead-after-covenant-school-shooting-in-green-hills/">The Covenant School</a> — just four miles away from Vanderbilt. <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/28/vanderbilt-and-elected-leaders-respond-to-covenant-school-shooting/">The university, elected officials</a> and the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/31/heartbreaking-vanderbilt-community-reacts-to-covenant-school-shooting/">Vanderbilt community</a> came together to grieve and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/30/in-photos-nashville-holds-vigil-in-honor-of-covenant-school-shooting-victims/">honor</a> the lives lost, but you also turned your sadness and anger into action. Vanderbilt students working with March for Our Lives and Students Demand Action <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/01/vanderbilt-students-organize-walkout-for-gun-control-honor-victims-of-covenant-school-shooting/">organized</a> a city-wide <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/11/in-photos-nashville-community-rallies-in-reaction-to-covenant-school-shooting-downtown-at-fisk-university/">walkout</a> on April 3, bringing together over <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/06/over-7000-rally-for-gun-reform-in-march-organized-by-vanderbilt-students-protests-to-continue-at-capitol/">7,000</a> students and community members to advocate for gun reform.</p>
                            <p>These efforts were not in vain — in the weeks following repeated protests, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/11/gov-lee-strengthens-background-checks-calls-for-red-flag-laws-in-wake-of-covenant-school-shooting-and-student-protests/">signed legislation</a> to strengthen background check requirements for firearm purchases and call for red flag laws. Despite the devastation, you remained hopeful: You expressed cautious optimism about President Joe Biden’s then-new national <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/12/vanderbilt-community-optimistic-hestitant-about-new-national-office-of-gun-violence-prevention/">Office of Gun Violence Prevention</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/08/weitzel-teaching-healed-me-but-vanderbilt-owes-its-teachers-so-much-more/">urged Vanderbilt</a> to leverage its power to protect our nation’s future teachers.</p>

                            <h11>Protest and advocacy</h11>
                            <p>Calling for stronger gun safety laws was only the beginning of your advocacy and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/05/notes-from-nash-notes-with-katey-parham-activism/">activism</a>. When “Tennessee Three” Reps. Justin Jones (D – Nashville), Justin Pearson (D – Memphis) and Gloria Johnson (D – Knoxville) joined the April 3 protesters in calls for gun control, and the former two were <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/07/the-nation-is-watching-students-lead-protests-as-rep-justin-jones-and-rep-justin-pearson-are-expelled/">expelled</a> from the Tennessee House, you led protests in support of their <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/12/reps-justin-jones-and-justin-pearson-unanimously-reinstated-students-lead-marches-in-support/">reinstatement.</a></p>
                            <p>When the Tennessee General Assembly convened in August to address gun violence, you <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/08/27/special-session-of-tennessee-congress-addressing-gun-violence-sparks-protests-by-vanderbilt-students-demand-action/">protested</a> proposed bills calling for additional firearms to be placed in schools. In October, you traveled to the grand opening of the headquarters of <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/12/students-demand-action-rally-against-smith-wesson-headquarters-grand-opening/">Smith & Wesson</a> — the nation’s largest gun manufacturer — in Maryville, Tenn., to denounce the organization’s “irresponsible practices and demand accountability.”</p>
                            <p>You also <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/20/liberation-justice-and-freedom-vanderbilt-students-attend-rally-for-palestine-at-statehouse/">gathered</a> at the Municipal Courthouse in April in support of Palestinian freedom. Activism over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict intensified dramatically following Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks that sparked an Israeli declaration of war. First, you mourned at a vigil for Israeli lives lost and at a community prayer for Palestinian lives lost.</p>
                            <p>Then, you <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/29/students-rally-outside-rand-dining-hall-in-support-of-israel-palestine/">protested</a> — some in support of Israel, others <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/21/students-call-for-ceasefire-in-gaza-at-rand-dining-center-amid-exhibits-from-sjp-hillel/">decrying</a> the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. Your advocacy took different forms, including <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/29/students-rally-outside-rand-dining-hall-in-support-of-israel-palestine/">rallies</a> outside Rand Dining Hall, <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/21/students-call-for-ceasefire-in-gaza-at-rand-dining-center-amid-exhibits-from-sjp-hillel/">banners</a> around campus, <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/21/students-call-for-ceasefire-in-gaza-at-rand-dining-center-amid-exhibits-from-sjp-hillel/">exhibits</a> in Fleming Yard and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/12/10/divinity-students-sjp-organize-in-support-of-gaza-ceasefire/">posters</a> at the Divinity School. Demonstrations extended beyond campus, too. You frequented protests at <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/15/protestors-call-for-ceasefire-in-middle-east-at-centennial-park/">Centennial Park</a> and downtown Nashville and traveled to Washington, D.C., for a national <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/21/vanderbilt-students-attend-national-march-for-israel-in-dc/">March for Israel.</a></p>
                            <p>As protests increased, so did hate-based incidents. As early as March, the nearby Sylvan Park neighborhood was <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/21/vanderbilt-community-reacts-to-sylvan-park-neighborhood-being-vandalized-with-swastikas-hate-speech/">vandalized</a> with swastikas and hate speech. The following month, the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/03/unacceptable-and-morally-reprehensible-vanderbilt-community-reacts-to-antisemitic-and-homophobic-vandalism-at-blair-school-of-music/">Blair School of Music</a> was also vandalized, both with an antisemitic symbol and homophobic language. Muslim and Jewish students on campus <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/30/muslim-students-voice-campus-safety-concerns-in-wake-of-war-in-gaza/">reported an increase</a> in Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents on campus in the wake of the conflict in Gaza and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/12/15/guest-editorial-vanderbilt-needs-to-do-more-to-stop-antisemitism-on-campus/">urged administrators</a> to take action.</p>
                            <p>On campus, students advocated for <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/22/smith-pay-vuceptors-or-risk-losing-them-for-good/">VUceptors</a>, graduate students, and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/06/14/elevate-the-people-on-the-ground-dining-employee-reflects-on-vanderbilt-experience/">staff</a> <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/23/a-true-leader-community-members-celebrate-life-of-staff-member-olivia-parrish/">members</a>: VUceptors voted in favor of award-style <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/23/vuceptors-vote-in-favor-of-award-style-compensation/">compensation</a>, A&S graduate student stipends <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/01/20/as-graduate-student-stipends-to-increase-by-up-to-7-9/">increased</a> by up to nearly 8%, the Student Health Insurance Plan added <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/03/ship-to-include-dental-and-vision-coverage-starting-this-fall/">dental and vision coverage</a>, and students launched the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/23/university-acknowledges-another-on-campus-construction-death-students-launch-dores-worker-solidarity-network/">Dores Worker Solidarity Network.</a></p>
                            
                            <h11>New technology emerges — and sparks controversy</h11>
                            <p>In 2023, ChatGPT and AI took the world by storm. In response to the shooting at Michigan State, an administrator of Peabody College’s Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion sent a message to students of condolence and support <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/17/peabody-edi-office-responds-to-msu-shooting-with-email-written-using-chatgpt/">written by ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/26/fellas-vanderbilts-chatgpt-email-is-automated-hypocrisy/">inciting sharp criticism</a> from the Vanderbilt — and global — communities. Two of the office’s deans <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/19/peabody-edi-deans-to-temporarily-step-back-following-chatgpt-crafted-message-about-msu-shooting/">temporarily stepped back</a> while an investigation was underway <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/12/peabody-edi-deans-nicole-joseph-hasina-mohyuddin-reinstated-after-utilizing-chatgpt-to-write-an-email-about-msu-shooting/">but were reinstated</a> just under two months later.</p>

                            <p>At the start of the 2023-24 academic year, U.S. News released its annual university rankings, dropping Vanderbilt five places to No. 18 — its <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/19/vanderbilt-drops-to-lowest-u-s-news-rank-since-2009-university-officials-denounce-methodology/">lowest ranking since 2009</a>.

                            <p>Despite the post-rankings frenzy, Vanderbilt’s admissions rates continued to decline — the university hit record low acceptance rates of <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/20/vanderbilt-admits-15-7-of-early-decision-applicants-record-low/">15.7% for early decision</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/20/record-low-5-6-of-applicants-admitted-to-class-of-2027-admission-rates-continue-to-decline/">5.6% for regular decision</a> for the Class of 2027.

                            <p>Amid violence, protest and controversy, Vanderbilt piloted the Dialogue Vanderbilt initiative to promote <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/12/notes-from-nash-notes-with-mchangama-free-speech/">free speech</a> and civil discourse on campus, which Diermeier has often <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/02/22/dialogue-vanderbilt-hosts-discussion-on-interfaith-dialogue-and-israel-palestine-conflict-with-maha-elgenaidi/">cited</a> as the reason for better campus civility compared to peer institutions.</p>
                            <p>As part of Dialogue Vanderbilt, the university hosted its inaugural <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/02/22/dialogue-vanderbilt-hosts-discussion-on-interfaith-dialogue-and-israel-palestine-conflict-with-maha-elgenaidi/">Free Speech Week</a> and curated a <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/16/dialogue-vanderbilt-hosts-visiting-fellow-jennifer-carlson-for-gun-rights-and-violence-discussion/">lineup</a> of Open Dialogue Visiting Fellows to speak on the initiative’s inaugural theme, “What is College For?

                            <p>Even before the official launch of Dialogue Vanderbilt, debates ensued on campus: Vanderbilt College Republicans hosted discourse over <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/01/26/both-sides-really-brought-their-a-game-vanderbilt-college-republicans-host-debate-on-affirmative-action/">affirmative action</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/10/vanderbilt-college-republicans-host-debate-on-gender-transitions-for-minors-students-protest-event/">gender-affirming care</a> for transgender minors — sparking backlash from students and campus organizations, while the university hosted a forum for discussion on university <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/05/vanderbilt-co-hosts-debate-on-tiktok-bans-at-universities/">TikTok bans</a>.</p>

Wounds heal with time, Noah tells us, but our fight to remain safe in school will continue. </p>

                            <p>I can’t read this piece without tearing up. As an education major, I have read the horrifying headlines of school shootings from the classroom as a student and from the sidelines as a pre-service teacher. Reading Opinion Editor Zoe Abel’s piece stuck with me because it was heartbreakingly unique. Her piece led me to think about my future and safety in the classroom — an unfortunate reality for educators everywhere.</p>

Students wrote about how <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/16/thumser-college-is-nothing-like-the-movies-and-thats-okay/">Vanderbilt isn’t perfect</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/01/huang-there-is-no-perfect-vanderbilt-experience/">imposter syndrome</a> but found that they definitely <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/15/abel-a-love-letter-to-everything-you-havent-figured-out-yet/">belong.</a></p>

                            <h11>Three restaurants added, six partners removed from Taste of Nashville</h11>

At the start of Fall 2023, Koi Sushi and Thai, Shokku Ramen and Velvet Taco <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/01/koi-sushi-and-thai-velvet-taco-shokku-ramen-no-longer-part-of-taste-of-nashville/">left</a> the program, though the Velvet Taco owner expressed interest in rejoining in 2024 after amending its Taste of Nashville food and beverage policy.</p>

                            <p>This year, you also heard from several artists on the rise. <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/12/the-secret-to-life-band-fizz-celebrates-years-of-friendship-and-music/">Fizz</a> discussed their first album drop, <a href = "https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/05/07/rising-artist-declan-mckenna-discusses-upcoming-tour-and-advice-for-students-pursuing-music-careers/">Declan McKenna</a> shared advice for aspiring musicians and Vanderbilt senior <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/03/amelia-day-on-connecting-to-her-inner-little-one-for-new-ep/">Amelia Day</a> shared what inspired her EP “Little One.” You also heard from 2023’s newest stars, like <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/08/26/i-wish-we-could-talk-forever-with-renee-rapp/">Reneé Rapp</a> discussing “Snow Angel,” her debut album.</p>
                        
                            <h11>Four Taylor Swift headliners</h11>
                            <p>Taylor Swift has made her mark on music, Nashville and football during 2023. The Hustler took <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/17/nashville-taylors-version-a-tour-of-nashville-through-taylor-swift-lyrics/">a trip around Nashville</a> to explore the city from the lens of Swift’s lyrics. <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/05/07/a-taylor-swift-homecoming-traveling-through-the-eras-in-nashville/">The Eras Tour</a> also came to Nashville on May 5, taking Swifties on a journey through all the Eras, while also announcing “Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)” that same night. For those who couldn’t see the Era’s Tour in person, <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/19/what-to-expect-at-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-concert-film/">the movie</a> “The Era’s Tour: Taylor Swift” might be able to still fulfill all of your “wildest dreams.”</p>
                            <p>Taylor also released <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/30/1989-taylors-version-proves-taylor-swift-never-goes-out-of-style/">“1989 (Taylor’s Version)”</a> on Oct. 27, giving listeners a fresh version of the original album with five new vault tracks.</p>

                            <h11>You celebrated the year with music and dance</h11>
                            <p>Many of the student performances in 2023 showcased the diversity of cultures on Vanderbilt’s campus. The African Student Union’s annual <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/17/in-photos-harambee-2023/">Harambee Showcase</a>, held on April 8, was themed “Shintsha Sunday” — “Swap Sunday” — and featured a skit weaved through a fashion show and various student dance and vocal performances.</p>
                            <p>The Association of Latin American Students also held its annual <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/05/cafe-con-leche-2023-a-night-of-stars-laughter-and-dance/">Café con Leche</a> on Oct. 28. Creating a spinoff of “Dancing with the Stars” — “Bailando Con Las Estrellas,” the showcase highlighted Hispanic and Latinx performers at Vanderbilt and guest acts while honoring prominent Latinx celebrities and public figures, particularly Cuban singer Celia Cruz.</p>
                            <p>SACE hosted <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/21/in-photos-back-to-the-dances-of-south-asia/">The Dances of South Asia</a> showcase on Nov. 4, which included dances, acapella performances and a fashion show. Students also took to the stage to perform as part of various campus dance groups, including <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/13/vitality-brought-dreams-to-life-in-their-showcase-in-your-dreams/">Vitality Dance Company</a>, <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/12/feeling-good-momentum-showcase-2023/">Vanderbilt Momentum Dance Company</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/12/05/vanderbilt-ballet-theatres-the-nutcracker-brought-christmas-magic-to-langford/">Vanderbilt Ballet</a> — the latter of which performed its annual rendition of “The Nutcracker” on Dec. 2.</p>
                            <p>Vanderbilt’s theatrical student organizations also hosted various musicals throughout 2023. The Original Cast performed student-crafted shows titled <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/12/07/the-original-cast-strutted-to-center-stage-for-their-fall-production-curtain-call/">“Curtain Call”</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/05/class-is-in-session-for-the-original-casts-production-of-introduction-to-astrology/">“Introduction to Astrology,”</a> while Vanderbilt Off-Broadway put on <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/20/vanderbilt-off-broadway-presents-final-show-of-school-year-violet/">“Violet”</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/01/19/9-to-5-preview-vanderbilt-off-broadways-spring-spectacular/">“9 to 5.”</a></p>

                            <h11>Victories on the court, alley and course</h11>
                            <p>After a <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/02/memorial-minutes-from-bad-to-worse/">shocking</a> 101-44 loss at the hands of Alabama, Vanderbilt Men’s Basketball turned its season around and made a run to the cusp of an NCAA Tournament berth. Magic returned to Memorial Gymnasium in a thrilling run that included last second-wins versus <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/08/vanderbilt-stuns-no-6-tennessee-on-tyrin-lawrence-buzzer-beater-beats-first-top-10-opponent-since-2016/">Tennessee</a>, <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/02/18/magic-hour-vanderbilt-beats-auburn-at-buzzer-again-wins-fifth-straight/">Auburn</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/02/bubble-watch-wright-commodores-stun-kentucky-to-keep-ncaa-hopes-alive/">Kentucky</a> (twice). The Commodores ultimately fell short of March Madness and settled for a quarterfinals run in the NIT, but it was a season to remember for the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/24/memorial-minutes-an-ode-to-the-improbadores/">“ImprobaDores.”</a></p>
                            <p>Vanderbilt Bowling continued to dominate in 2023, <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/14/breaking-vanderbilt-bowlings-mabel-cummins-wins-national-player-of-the-year-john-williamson-coach-of-the-year/">led by</a> National Player of the Year Mabel Cummins and Coach of the Year John Williamson. The Commodores overcame adversity and won their <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/16/one-shining-moment-vanderbilt-bowling-wins-third-national-championship/">third-ever national championship</a> in Las Vegas.</p>
                            <p>On the golf course, Gordon Sargent caught fire in 2023 when he shined at the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/05/gordon-sargent-at-the-masters-an-opportunity-unlike-any-other/">Masters</a> and won the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/06/23/gordon-sargent-wins-low-amateur-at-u-s-open-finishes-4-over-par/">low amateur at the U.S. Open</a>. This fall, he officially earned his <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/21/gordon-sargent-earns-a-new-rank-pga-tour-member/">PGA TOUR card</a>, meaning he can turn pro in the 2024-25 season.</p>

                            <h11>No Omaha, no bowl game</h11>
                            <p>For the second consecutive year, the VandyBoys failed to make it to Omaha for the College World Series. Vanderbilt was unable to take its momentum from winning the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/05/29/no-6-vandyboys-win-sec-tournamnet-will-host-ncaa-regional-tournament-for-ninth-time-in-program-history/">SEC Tournament</a> into the NCAA Regional. Vanderbilt’s season ended when it lost to both <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/06/04/vandyboys-fall-2-1-to-xavier-eliminated-from-ncaa-regional/">Xavier</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/06/03/ncaa-regional-no-6-vandyboys-upset-by-no-24-oregon-ducks-8-7/">Oregon</a> in the NCAA Regional.</p>
                            <p>In Football head coach Clark Lea’s third season, the Commodores won just <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/26/commodore-brunch-week-13-knocking-on-the-door/">two games</a>. Quarterbacks <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/08/25/qb-aj-swann-is-built-to-be-vanderbilts-signal-caller/">AJ Swann</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/20/full-circle-how-perspective-and-humility-helped-ken-seals-regain-the-starting-quarterback-position/">Ken Seals</a> were underwhelming and then transferred after the season. Right before the football season, The Hustler created <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/03/anchor-analysis-episode-2-vanderbilt-football-scores-six-touchdowns-against-alabama-am/">Anchor Analysis</a>, a post-game talk show hosted after <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/04/anchor-analysis-episode-7-vanderbilt-falls-to-auburn-in-final-home-game/">every home game</a>. After the season, The Hustler created a <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/29/vanderbilt-football-offseason-transaction-tracker/">101 for all of Vanderbilt Football’s offseason movements</a>.</p>
                            <p>Vanderbilt Soccer was led by <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/28/amber-nguyen-an-excuse-free-maestro/">Amber Nguyen</a> and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/09/13/rachel-deresky-back-to-her-goal-scoring-ways/">Rachel Deresky</a> in 2023. The Commodores had star power but did not make it to the <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/01/2023-season-recap-vanderbilt-soccer/">SEC Tournament</a> after <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/10/26/vanderbilt-soccer-concludes-2023-season-in-a-heartbreak-falls-to-rival-tennessee-1-0/">losing to Tennessee</a> in the season finale.</p>
